# mbp_battery_indicator
a lightweight battery indicator plugin for the argos gnome extension

since the upower battery percentage readings are not correct for the 2012 macbook pro (9.2), it's a lightweight bash script which outputs the correct battery percentage and it can be run from the argos gnome extension

after downloading don't forget to set the script's permissions to be executable (e.g. sudo chmod u+x filename.sh)
